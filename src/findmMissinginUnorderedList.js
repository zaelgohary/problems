// My dog ate my thesis
// I printed my thesis, but my dog mixed up all the pages.

// I don’t have time to reorder them. Fortunately, I can give it “as is” to my professors. They love spending time sorting things, and the pages are numbered from 1 to 5000. Yes, it’s a very large document.

// However, I saw my dog eating one of the pages. I have to reprint it, but I do not know which one it is.

// The deadline is in a few minutes, so I can only browse through the remaining pages once.

// Can you help me?

// If possible, please observe these additional constraints: I do not have a pencil, and my computer’s battery is so low that the only thing it can do as its final action is print the page I select. I have an old calculator that I can use to perform only the four basic arithmetic operations.

// (Opening my dog is not an option).


// Find the missing number in an unordered list
// Can only do basic operations
// allowed to loop once

function findMissingPage(pages, n) {
  const expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  const actualSum = pages.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0)

  return expectedSum - actualSum;
}

console.log(findMissingPage([1, 6, 5, 3, 2], 6))
